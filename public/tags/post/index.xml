      <description>No wonder.
Without toml the site won&amp;rsquo;t publish
This is getting chaotic and I&amp;rsquo;m getting no where. These posts were typed on the iPad from the 2nd generation and works fine. No need to install anything it runs off the internet
It&amp;rsquo;s about figuring out how to get the themes going.</description>

      <description>Can I shout for joy?
It&amp;rsquo;s almost a success. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got the website running on appernetic.io and on the most basic amp theme. I&amp;rsquo;ve got the posts appearing on the front page and attempting to make the &amp;laquo;about&amp;raquo; sections to show up.
Let&amp;rsquo;s try changing theme. If you can read this then the theme change was successful.
Also trying to move a post from default to go under &amp;laquo;post&amp;raquo; directory so that it shows up on front page.</description>
