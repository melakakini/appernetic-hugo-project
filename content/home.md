This is the home file and how about some *markdown* Not even clear how -this- works
So if I used **bold** Oh that's cool. Appernetic allows me to edit with their editor menu *without memorising* the codes and i can even [hearing aid links][1] and now am impressed, How about 

> Blockquotes and how this would affect the formattting?
This is sad. Have still nothing to show for all the time on the internet. SO how?

    enter the codes here. So what's the markdown?
    this is for coding when i put in 4 spaces
if I type directly from the sides then there will be no formatting 
when i use the > sign then the format changes
>this is for blockquote
so how do I end a blockquote?
