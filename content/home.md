This is the home file and how about some *markdown* Not even clear how -this- works
So if I used **bold** Oh that's cool. Appernetic allows me to edit with their editor menu *without memorizing* the codes and i can even [make links][1] and now am impressed, How about

    enter the codes here. So what's the markdown?
