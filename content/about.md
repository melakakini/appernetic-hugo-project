Am writing on appernetic to try out their features as I've been struggling to get a site up with console/.terminal but without much success
So this about section is about how I'm testing out appernetic for Melaka Kini News

    This is me again writing in MD.
This is so cool. Appernetic replied to my messages on gitter. Shout out to Appernetic.
    It's tough enough having to learn git and then hugo and then firebase and then appernetic comes along.
What a relief.
***Shout out to appernetic***
