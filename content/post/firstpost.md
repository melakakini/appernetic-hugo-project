This is the first post and i have no clue what so ever what's happening.
Been typing the about section and now the first post section and am still wondering what's going to happen to get it to happen.
#update
Have just seen the youtube "silent movie" style tutorial and published it
but nothing is seen yet. WIll come back and test in 15 mins

Am back and today it's the 28th of April and am not making much progress. The settings file keeps getting deleted and the GitHub does not show the files like a Hugo site should. So it's not hugo I remind myself. It's appernetic :)
