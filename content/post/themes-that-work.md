Thanks to all the hardworking and *creative theme makers* that post to Hugo.

thanks to you guys I get to have nice looking site. Thank you for your efforts I get my thoughts out. 

***But why?***

    Why should anyone crack their heads to provide FREE themes to others? Why spend nights perfecting their themes so that others can have beautiful websites? 

It's amazing! you guys rock.
