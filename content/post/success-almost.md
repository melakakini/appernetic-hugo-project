Can I shout for joy?

It's almost a success. I've finally got the website running on appernetic.io and on the most basic amp theme. I've got the posts appearing on the front page and attempting to make the "about" sections to show up. 

Let's try changing theme. If you can read this then the theme change was successful. 

Also trying to move a post from default to go under "post" directory so that it shows up on front page. 

Take note that this post's header is in yaml while all the earlier ones were in toml

Why should one go for such hard was to publish when there's free wix website builders with tons of free pictures? Why do I struggle to put up plain pages? Is it worth it?


How did I change the front matter from TOML to yaml??
